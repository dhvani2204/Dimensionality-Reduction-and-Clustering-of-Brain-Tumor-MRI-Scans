# Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Clustering-of-Brain-Tumor-MRI-Scans

This project focuses on the Distance Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction of MRI scans of patients suffering from brain tumors mainly of 3 types: Meningioma, Glioma,
and Pituitary tumor. Principle component analysis is the technique applied. The performance evaluation in the form of the percentage of variance retained, disparity, MSE, PSNR and SSIM score. A comparison of the distance matrices has also been done between the cancer classes and between original and PCA-applied images. The project further aims to identify the most suitable clustering algorithm for accurately identifying different slice-section images of brain tumors: longitudinal, transversal and frontal. We compared the performance of several algorithms using the dataset of brain tumor MRI images. K-means was found to be the best algorithm and was selected based on the visual analysis of the clustering results, where the separation of distinct and non-overlapping clusters of the 3 slice section views, gave a satisfactory outcome for all the types of cancers. By clustering similar view images together, health professionals would be able to create representative prototypes for the tumor types. This can be utilized to classify and diagnose new MRI scans more efficiently, potentially aiding in accurate and quicker tumor identification.
